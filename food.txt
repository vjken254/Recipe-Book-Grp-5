Ingredients:

2 cups basmati rice
1 lb (450g) meat (chicken, beef, or lamb), cut into bite-sized pieces
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ginger, grated
2 cups mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, and green beans work well)
4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 tablespoons pilau masala (a spice blend available in stores, or you can make your own with cumin, coriander, cardamom, and cloves)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

Rinse the rice: Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from being too sticky.

Prepare the ingredients: Chop the onion, tomatoes, and vegetables. Grate the ginger and mince the garlic.

Sauté the aromatics: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they are translucent.

Add meat: Add the meat pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides.

Add spices: Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and pilau masala. Cook for a minute or until fragrant.

Add vegetables: Add the chopped tomatoes and mixed vegetables. Cook for another 3-5 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.

Add rice: Add the rinsed basmati rice to the pot and stir well to coat the rice with the spices and vegetables.

Add broth: Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil.

Simmer: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed.

Fluff and serve: Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired.

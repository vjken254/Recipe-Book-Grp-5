Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish made with basmati rice, meat (such as chicken, mutton, or beef), and a blend of spices. Here's a basic recipe for Chicken Biryani:

Ingredients:

For Marination:

500g chicken, cut into pieces
1 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder
Salt to taste
For Rice:

2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes
4-5 cups water for boiling
1-2 bay leaves
4-5 green cardamom pods
4-5 cloves
2-inch cinnamon stick
Salt to taste
For Biryani:

3 tablespoons ghee or cooking oil
2 large onions, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup chopped mint leaves
1/2 cup chopped coriander leaves
1 teaspoon biryani masala
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (for color and flavor)
Fried onions (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:

Marinate the Chicken:

In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 1-2 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.
Cook the Rice:

Boil the soaked basmati rice with bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set aside.
Prepare Fried Onions:

In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee and fry thinly sliced onions until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove and set aside.
Cook the Chicken:

In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat ghee or oil. Add the marinated chicken and cook until it's partially cooked and the yogurt is well blended. Add chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, and garam masala. Cook until the chicken is almost done.
Layering:

In the same pan, layer half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken. Sprinkle half of the chopped mint and coriander leaves. Repeat the layers with the remaining rice and herbs.
Add Saffron Milk:

Drizzle the saffron-soaked milk over the rice. You can also add a few drops of kewra or rose water for added fragrance.
Dum Cooking:

Cover the pan tightly with a lid or seal with aluminum foil. Cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to cook completely.
Serve:

Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Garnish with fried onions and additional chopped mint and coriander leaves. Serve hot with raita or a side salad.
